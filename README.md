## My process
Used Sass for styling. Started with html, then the styling, and then the JavaScript. I adjusted the html and SCSS as needed according
to the JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I think this project overall, for me just gave me further practice for making html emails and getting used to Sass, as I didn't use
it much before. 


### Continued development

I want to keep using practical JavaScript
